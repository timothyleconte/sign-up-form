Sign up form assignment for Odin

8/19/25 2156 - project start!

8/20/25 - been working my 3 shifts in a row so not able to do a ton but I did get the major part of the scaffolding out of the way. The remaining stuff is mostly styling and flexbox work. Hoping to maybe finish tomorrow? If not, definitely on sunday after the camping trip!
